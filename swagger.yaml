            on the same DID document are using mutually agreed terminology. 
            @context property should be represented by the link to document

            is inappropriate for the context, country names should be provided

            The concept of adding a globally unique identifier for each instance 
            of an address is a crucial part of the INSPIRE data spec. A number 
            of EU countries have already implemented an ID (a UUID) in their 
            address register/gazetteer, among them Denmark. It is the address 
            identifier that allows an address to be represented in a format 
            other than INSPIRE whilst remaining conformant to the core 
            vocabulary. The identifier is a hook that can be used to link the 
            address to an alternative representation, such as vCard.

          description: 
            A number or a sequence of characters that uniquely identifies 
            the locator within the relevant scope. The locator designator is 
            a number or a sequence of characters that uniquely identifies 
            the locator within the relevant scope(s). The full identification 
            of the locator could include one or more locator designators. 
            In simpler terms, this is the building number, apartment number, 
            etc. It is characteristic that these designators, according to 
            tradition or to a specific set of rules, are assigned 
            systematically. For example address numbers are most often assigned 
            in ascending order with odd and even numbers on each side of the 
            thoroughfare. Another example is the floor identifier that in 
            a standardized way expresses on which level the address is located. 
            The key difference between a locator designator and a locator name 
            is that the latter is a proper name and is unlikely to include 
            digits.

          description: 
            A proper noun applied to the real world entity identified by 
            the address. The locator name is a proper noun applied to the real 
            world entity identified by the locator. The locator name could be 
            the name of the property or complex, of the building or part of 
            the building, or it could be the name of a room inside a building. 
            The key difference between a locator designator and a locator name 
            is that the latter is a proper name and is unlikely to include 
            digits. e.g. "Rose Cottage", "Grand Suite",

    LocationReference:

        implies only that the legal entity has some connection to a location 
        in time or space. It does not imply that the legal entity is necessarily 
        at that location at the time when the assertion is made.

            A proper noun applied to a spatial object. The country codes defined

            preferred over either the long form or short form of a country's 
            name (as they are less error prone). The Publications Office of 
            the European Union recommends the use of "ISO 3166-1" codes for 
            countries in all cases except two - use "UK" in preference to 
            the "ISO 3166" code GB for the United Kingdom; - use "EL" in 
            preference to the "ISO 3166" code GR for Greece. Where a country 
            has changed its name or no longer exists (such as Czechoslovakia, 
            Yugoslavia, etc.) use the "ISO 3166-3" code. Known diversity that 
            one has to deal with when exchanging country names between different 
            communication partners without relying on an agreed code list are 
            a. Long form vs. short form of a country name (e.g. “Federal 
            Republic of Germany” vs. Germany), b. Different languages (Italy vs. 
            Italia), c. Historic name vs. Current name (Burma vs. Myanmar), d. 
            Ambiguity of similar sounding countries (“Republic of the Congo” vs. 
            “Democratic Republic of the Congo”). e.g. "Athens", "DE"

        geographicIdentifier:
          description:
            A URI that identifies the location. GeoNames.org provides stable, 
            widely recognised identifiers for more than "10" million 
            geographical names that can be used as links to further information. 
            For example, "http://sws.geonames.org/593116/"" identifies 
            the Lithuanian capital Vilnius. 
            Unfortunately these URIs cannot easily be automatically 
            deduced since the URI scheme uses simple numeric codes. Finding a 
            GeoNames identifier for a location is almost always a manual process. 
            Where such identifiers are known or can be found, however, 
            it is recommended to use them. Where the Location class is used to 
            identify a country, if the GeoNames URI is not known, the 
            recommendation is to use the URI from the Named Authority List (NAL) 
            for countries of the Publications Office of the EU. As noted for the 
            Georaphic Name property, the EU's Publication Office diverges from 
            "ISO 3166-1" and uses EL and UK for Greece and the United Kingdom 
            respectively. e.g. "http://sws.geonames.org/593116/", 
            "http://publications.europa.eu/resource/authority/country/AUT"

            to record such names but should not be used to record translations 
            of the primary legal name. Where more than one legal name exists

            languages, identify the language used in each of the multiple legal

            number of identifiers (but only one legal identifier). For example, 
            in many jurisdictions, a business will have one or more tax numbers 
            associated with them which do not, by themselves, confer legal 
            entity status. The Identifier property must not be used to link 
            to the identifier issued by the authority that conferred legal 
            entity status on a business.

        companyStatus:
          description: 
            The status of the business. The terms 'insolvent', 'bankrupt' and 
            'in receivership', for example, are likely to mean slightly 
            different things with different legal implications in different 
            jurisdictions. XBRL Europe is in the process of defining 
            a cross-border vocabulary for company status. Taking the existing 
            XBRL work as a starting point, the term "Normal Activity" does 
            appear to have cross-border usefulness and this should be used 
            in preference to terms like "trading" or "operating". Best Practice 
            for recording various other status levels is to use the relevant 
            jurisdiction's terms and to do so in a consistent manner. e.g. 
            "Normal Activity", "Insolvent", "Bankrupt", "In Receivership"
          type: string
        companyActivity:
          description: 
            The activity of the business. Several controlled vocabularies exist 
            for recording the activity of a company, many of which map to 
            the UN's ISIC codes. Where a particular controlled vocabulary is 
            in use within a given context, such as SIC codes in the UK, it is 
            acceptable to use these. However, the preferred choice for European 
            interoperability is NACE.
